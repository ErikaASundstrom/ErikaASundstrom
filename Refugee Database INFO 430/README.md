# Refugee Database | INFO 430

This database was created to store information on displaced persons such as age, gender, start location, moved location, financial stability, help from organizations, etc. in 
order to better understand the needs of displaced persons and how best to help them. The finalized entity relationship diagram (ERD) is included here. The final database was coded 
in SQL and includes populated tables, stored procedures, computed columns, business rules, check constraints, views, and error-handling.
