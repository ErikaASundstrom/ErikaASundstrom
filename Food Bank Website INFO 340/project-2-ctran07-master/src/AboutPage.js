                                The COVID-19 outbreak  has generated a sudden, unprecedented need for both support and donations
                                at food banks across the country. Although this crisis has a unique universal impact, disproportionate
                                repercussions still plague the most vulnerable populations. Food banks are calling on
                                individuals in more secure positions to donate food and lower-risk demographics to consider
                                volunteering via news outlets and social media.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because food banks' supply and need varies daily, sometimes it's unclear how and where to help.
                                We believe donating shouldn't be hard. Potluck aims to connect willing donators and volunteers with
                                foodbanks near them that have the most need, as  well as indicate what is needed. Join us in
                                closing the food deficit gap!
