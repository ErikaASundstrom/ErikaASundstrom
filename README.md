# Erika Sundstrom's Portfolio

This is a portfolio for projects listed on my resume and other projects that I am proud of. This portfolio showcases the kinds of projects I have done, the languages I've 
worked with, and the tools I use when creating coding projects. Not every project has working links still, therefore, some projects may not be viewed in their final form. However, 
the code is still there. Projects without working links will be shown in _italics_ below. **Each project has its own separate folder.**

Projects Currently Included:
1. Olympics Data | INFO 201
2. Refugee Database | INFO 430
3. _Pet Adoption Helper_ | INFO 340
4. _Seattle Food Banks_ | INFO 340
