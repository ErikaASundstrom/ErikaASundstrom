    <h1>Project 1 Proposal</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Problem description</h2>
        <p>A food bank is a non-profit organization that serves as a collection site for food donations and provides
            relief to food-insecure people and charities. Like a bank that stores money, a food bank aggregates food
            (typically through donations), and helps redistribute it to other donation agencies. Food banks are particularly
            special right now in the current COVID-19 epidemic – thousands of locations around the country are 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/economy/coronavirus-food-banks.html">running out of supplies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A pain point that most food banks encounter is how frequently they must turn away some donations, as each food bank
            has their own specific limitations on what types of food and how much daily volume they're allowed to accept. Long term,
            this disincentivizes people from contributing their food donations, in fear that they will be rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://mealconnect.org">MealConnect</a> is a service that currently aids in partnering donors to food banks.
            However, it currently is only supported in Texas – which is not nearly as impacted by COVID-19 as Seattle or New York.
            MealConnect is also more targeted for businesses, who have large quantities of frequently wasted food, rather than
            individuals.

        <h2>Proposed application</h2>
        <p>For this project, I will be working with Olivia Oplinger.</p>
        <p>Users for our web application are all individuals with a surplus of food, and are looking for the simplest way donation
            process. The following food bank information will be surfaced to users:
            <ul>
                <li>Hours of operation</li>
                <li>Distance from food bank to user</li>
                <li>Types of food eligible for donation</li>
                <li>Instructions on how to properly package food</li>
                <li>Volume capacity per donation, and how close the bank is to reaching that limit</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Within our app, users will be able to:
            <ul>
                <li>Enter their zip code and view nearby food donation centers</li>
                <li>Enter food items (and volume) and get matched with food donation centers accepting that specific food</li>
                <li>Search for specific food bank by name and see more details (hours of operation)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The affordances listed above will streamline help users find the exact food bank that can take their donations, without
            risk of rejection.
